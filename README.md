# Flutter + ROS2 + YOLOX

## Integrating ROS 2, YOLOX, and Flutter for Real-Time Object Detection and Communication

This project that involves communication between ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), YOLOX (a real-time object detection model), and a Flutter application to send image data is a complex and multi-step process. Below, I'll outline the general steps and components involved in such a project:

- Install and set up Integration of ROS2 and YOLOX. Here the doc is https://github.com/thianlianben-gs/ros2-yolox-python
- Set up a development environment for Flutter and develop application
